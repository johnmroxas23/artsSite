If I could fly
I'd be comin' right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything, just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
I can feel your heart inside of mine
I feel it, I feel it
I've been goin' out of my mind
I feel it, I feel it
Know that I'm just wastin' time
And I hope that you don't run from me
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only

I want to write you a song
One that's beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I want to write you a song
I want to lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You'll have a hiding place you can go
I want to lend you my coat
Everything I need I get from you
Givin' back is all I wanna do
I want to build you a boat
One that's strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I want to build you a boat
Everything I need I get from you

So girl, why are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
You're tearing me apart
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah, girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me, like before
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts, 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby, tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say, it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not movin' on
Baby, even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you
We're so Paris, when we kissed, when we kissed
I remember the taste of your lipstick

No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby, tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say, it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not movin' on
Baby, even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you
We're so Paris, when we kissed, when we kissed
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You're tearing up my heart
Did I do something stupid?
Yeah, girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me, like before
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts, 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby, tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say, it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby, even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me, like before
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts, 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby, tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say, it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby, even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

If I could fly
I'd be comin' right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything, just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
I can feel your heart inside of mine
I feel it, I feel it
I've been goin' out of my mind
I feel it, I feel it
Know that I'm just wastin' time
And I hope that you don't run from me
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
I'll show you my heart
For when you're lonely
And forget who you are
I'm missing half of me
When we're apart
Now you know me
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
For your eyes only

I want to write you a song
One that's beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I want to write you a song
I want to lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You'll have a hiding place you can go
I want to lend you my coat
Everything I need I get from you
Givin' back is all I wanna do
I want to build you a boat
One that's strong as you are free
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink
You know it won't
I want to build you a boat
Everything I need I get from you
Givin' back is all I wanna do
Everything I need I get from you
Givin' back is all I wanna do
I want to write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I want to write you a song
I want to write you a song

But everything you do is magic
So l-l-let them take the pictures
Spread it all around the world now (da-da, da-da-da, da, da, da, da)

You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say, "Goodbye"
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart
You're so London, your own style, your own style
And together we're so good
